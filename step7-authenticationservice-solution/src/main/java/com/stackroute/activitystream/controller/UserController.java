 * has handler methods which returns a view. However, if we use @ResponseBody annotation along
 * with @Controller annotation, it will return the data directly in a serialized 
 * format. Starting from Spring 4 and above, we can use @RestController annotation which 
 * is equivalent to using @Controller and @ResposeBody annotation
