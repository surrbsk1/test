## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 7 UserCircleService - Activity Stream Assignment

### Problem Statement

In this case study Activity Stream Step 7 - UserCircleService, We will write main class for spring boot Application, configuration class, model class, repository class, service class and interface, logging aspect.

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 2: Create Schema UserCircleServiceDB.
    Step 3: Write code for model class(i.e UserCircle).
    Step 4: Write code for UserCircleRepository (i.e Write Query to get user circle object,Write a query to retrive circle name from usercircle matching with username).
    step 5: Go thru UserCircleService methods Don't change any method.
    step 6: Implement UserCircleService methods in UserCircleServiceImpl class.
    step 7: Write code for UserCircleController class.
    step 8: Write the code for JwtFilter in config package.
    step 9: Write code for logger in LoggingAspecUserCircle.java class consider all methods in controller classes.
    step 10: Write code for logger in LoggingAspectUserCircleService.java class consider all methods in Service classes.
    step 11: Go thru UserCircleServiceSpringBootApplication.java class.
    step 12: Run UserCircleControllerTest.java class.
    step 13: Run Spring boot application (i.e Run As -> spring boot app).
