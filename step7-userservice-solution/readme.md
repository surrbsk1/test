## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 7 UserService - Activity Stream Assignment

### Problem Statement

In this case study Activity Stream Step 7 - UserService, We will write main class for spring boot Application, configuration class, model class, repository class, service class and interface, logging aspect.

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 2: Create Schema UserServiceDB.
    Step 3: Write code for model class(i.e User class).
    Step 4: Write code for UserRepository (i.e Write Query to validate user).
    step 5: Go thru UserService methods Don't change any method.
    step 6: Implement UserService methods in UserServiceImpl class.
    step 7: Write code for UserController class.
    step 8: Write the code for JwtFilter in config package.
    step 9: Write code for logger in LoggingAspecUser.java class consider all methods in controller classes.
    step 10: Write code for logger in LoggingAspectUserService.java class consider all methods in Service classes.
    step 11: Go thru UserServiceSpringBootApplication.java class.
    step 12: Run UserControllerTest.java class.
    step 13: Run Spring boot application (i.e Run As -> spring boot app).
